        <!-- NOTE: Testing revealed that all other assemblies can be safely removed!
             FastEndpoints uses source generators which eliminate the need for runtime reflection.
             This saves ~3.3 MB from the published binary (158.16 MB → 154.87 MB).
             
             Previously preserved assemblies (no longer needed):
             - FastEndpoints (source-generated discovery)
             - FastEndpoints.Attributes (compile-time only)
             - FluentValidation (properly trimmed by AOT)
             - Microsoft.AspNetCore.* (properly handled by trimmer)
             - System.Text.Json (source-generated serialization)
